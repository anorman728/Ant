# Ant v. 1.1.0.


"Ant" is an acronym for "Andrew Norman's Timelogger."  On a schedule that you define, it will ask you "What are you working on right now?", then will take your response and store it in a CSV file with a timestamp, which can be opened in a spreadsheet program like Excel.  

For example, if you set it up to ask you once an hour on the hour, by the end of the day you will have an hourly record of what you were working on that day.
