# Ant

This project is intended to help you keep track of what you're working on.  It will prompt you on a schedule and ask "What are you working on right now?"  Then, it will add the result to a CSV file with a timestamp so you have a spreadsheet that can be opened in Excel/LibreOffice to see what you've worked on throughout the day.

It's written in C# using Gtk# to make it cross-platform.

ATM, it's nowhere near complete.
