# Ant

This project is intended to help you keep track of what you're working on and how long you've been working on it.

It will prompt you on a schedule and ask "What are you working on right now?"  Then, it will add the result to a CSV file with a timestamp so you have a spreadsheet that can be opened in Excel/LibreOffice to see what you've worked on throughout the day.

I had previously attempted to do this using Gtk# to make it cross-platform, but that was not working out because it seems to be too buggy.  It now uses a traditional Windows Forms setup.

ATM, it's functional, but not yet complete.  Still need to add the ability to save settings, add an icon, and an "About" popup window.
